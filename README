*** Before using this script, you should check out Limp - http://mikael.jansson.be/hacking/limp/docs/
It gives an experience much closer to SLIME, and is most likely a better solution. ***

An omnifunc that provides SLIME style completion of compound keywords.

e.g.   \"m-v-b<C-X><C-O>\" expands to \"multiple-value-bind\"

This isn&#039t anything close to a reimplementation of SLIME completion, but provides something closer to the default behavior. Most importantly, since there isn&#039t a connection to swank and a live lisp instance, you can only complete static keywords from the syntax file. (like syntaxcomplete.vim -- in fact this started out as a quick munging of that file, and still has lots of its code in there) Also, currently only \"simple\" and \"compound\" modes work, there is no support for \"fuzzy\" completion.
